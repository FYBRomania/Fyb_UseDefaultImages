# Installation details

## Minimum requirements
We are using strict requirements in the `composer.json` file, to make sure compatibility follows from the `composer` requirements. When you have questions regarding compatibility, install the extension via `composer`. If it works, it is because it is compatible. If it does not work, it is because it is not compatible. When a new version of Magento comes out and the `composer` command fails, while you think it should actually work, open a support ticket so we can look into this.

## Instructions for using composer

Use composer to install this extension. First make sure that Magento is installed via composer, and that there is a valid `composer.json` file present.

Next, install our module using the following command:

    composer require fyb/module-use-default-images

Next, install the new module plus its dependency `Fyb_UseDefaultImages` into Magento itself:

    bin/magento module:enable Fyb_UseDefaultImages
    bin/magento setup:upgrade
    bin/magento setup:di:compile
    bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy

## Instructions for manual copy

Download a ZIP of this repository. Extract the files. Upload the files to the folder `app/code/Fyb/UseDefaultImages` of your site.

Next, install the new module into Magento itself:

    bin/magento module:enable Fyb_UseDefaultImages
    bin/magento setup:upgrade
    bin/magento setup:di:compile
    bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy
